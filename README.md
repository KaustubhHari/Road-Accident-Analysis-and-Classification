# Road-Accident-Analysis-and-Classification
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze road accident data and predict accident severity based on various factors such as time, day of the week, age of the driver, and more. The analysis involves various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the nature of accidents, followed by machine learning classification models to predict accident outcomes using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
